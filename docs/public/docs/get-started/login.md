# Login and authentication

This section explains how to authenticate with the Proton Pass CLI.

## Web login

To log in with your Proton account:

```bash
pass-cli login
```

Then, open the URL that you will see in your web browser, complete the authentication flow, and your Proton Pass CLI will be automatically logged in.

## Other login options

For alternative login flows, please check the [login command reference](../commands/login.md).
